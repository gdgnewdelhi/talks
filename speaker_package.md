# Speaker's Package
The following is a general starter package for giving presentations at GDG New Delhi.
They are _suggestions only_ with the exception of the **Talk Requirements**. Feel free to adapt them to your particular topic or presentation style.

## Talk Requirements
The following are rules every talk must respect:

- It must be related to the tech industry (even if loosely related).
- It must not sell or pitch.
- It must not be used as marketing.
- It can not be a recruiting tool.
- It must respect our [code of conduct](https://github.com/gdgnewdelhi/code-of-conduct/blob/master/community_coc.md).

## The Community Stage Format
At GDG New Delhi, we generally have 
- Lightinig Talks (15-30 mins)
- Standard Talks (30-60 mins)
- Codelabs (1 - 1.5 hours)
- Workshops (1.5 - 3 hours)

## General Overview
1. Introduce yourself
  - Who are you?
  - What do you do?
  - Why are you interested in this topic?
  - Humanize yourself: what is something else about you?
    - Are you a coffee snob, play in a metal band, or have a particularly lazy cat?
  - Feel free to self-promote (as long as you don't do a recruiting pitch for a company)

2. Situate the topic
  - Give a very high-level overview or analogy to sum up what you're going to talk about
  - Was it a fun project or experience?
  - Is it a product that is gaining popularity? Why?
  - Are there competing technologies or ideas? Why choose this one?

3. Introduce the main ideas
  - This is the main body of the presentation
  - Most people budget for about 4-6 minutes on the main topic
    - You need to leave time to wrap up later, and you spent some time in the introduction
  - Keep the slides simple, preferably images, analogies and examples
    - Speak on the details
      - Feel free to bring cue cards or use the speaker's notes feature in Keynote or PowerPoint
      - If you prefer, you can also ad lib! Totally up to you!

4. Time check! If you're at nearing your allotted time, it's probably time to start wrapping up!
  - If you need an extra few minutes, don't sweat it. Just try to keep as close to 10 minutes as possible.

5. Summarize the talk
  - Did you learn something important?
  - Where can people go to find out more?
  - Can people come find you afterwards if they're interested?

6. If you're open to it, provide a way for people to reach out about further info
  - Twitter handle
  - GitHub link
  - Email address

## Advice & Gotchas
- The audience at GDG New Delhi is _very_ diverse, with a wide set of backgrounds and levels of experience
  - Assume that people have not had experience with this topic before
- We have found that having slides is helpful for framing the topic, and to provide visual example
- Use animated gifs whenever possible. Seriously. People love animated gifs.
- Live coding can work well, as long as the examples are kept short and simple.
  - Don't forget to bump up the font size _way up_ for the projector!
- Do a dry run at home to get a sense of time and flow
- This isn't your one chance that you _must get right_. You can speak many times!
- Quite a few of our members have spoken. We know that it can be intimidating. Don't worry! We're rooting for you!
